# Scripts to mirror repositories

This repo contains scripts to mirror all R package sources from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org),
[rOpenSci](https://github.com/ropensci/roregistry) and
[BioConductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___Software).
These mirrors are then used to generate data for:

- https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats
- https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgmatch

Both of these repositories also include GitHub actions to update data on a
daily basis. These scripts are intended to be used only to regenerate all
results from full local mirrors of these repositories.
